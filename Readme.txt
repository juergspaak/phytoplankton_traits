An up to date version of the python code can best be fetched on
https://github.com/juergspaak/phytoplankton_traits
along with the submodules
https://github.com/juergspaak/phytoplankton_communities
and
https://github.com/juergspaak/NFD_definitions
The code is optimally aranged with a subfolder "phytoplankton_communities", this folder should contain
all files documented in Readme_communities.csv

master_program.py
	Runs the simulation and then plots all the figure
	Figures may differ slightly from figures shown in the paper due to smaller
	simulation time length

sim_data_photoprotection.py
	Simulate phytoplankton communities
	Calls the folder "phytoplankton_communities" which creates phytoplankton communities
	Optimally, this programm is run multiple times in parallel, if done so, change
	the "save" variable on line 19. Each individually run program must have its own
	save variable to avoid overwriting. The simulated data is saved in the subfolder /data
	Before running plots.py all created files must be combined manually to one file
	In principal this code allows for many adjustments on the phytoplankton
	communities created, this file only creates the simulations performed in the main text
	
load_data.py
	Loads the data created by sim_data_photoprotection into python for convenience

plot_*.py
	plots the corresponding plot from the manuscript
	Partial data from figure 3 is not public (data owned by third person).
	If figure 3 is recreated with plot_figure_3_EF.py the corresponding data will be missing

plots.py
	Calls all plot_*.py and creates all figure in the main text

linearregressions.py
	Performes linear regressions from the main text. Saves all results in
	Table_linearregressions.csv

##########################################################################
Data
##########################################################################

Table_linregressions.csv
	Results of the linear regressions discussed in the main text

data/
	Folder containing the data generated by the jobarray_* and sim_* files
